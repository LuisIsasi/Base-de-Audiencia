   HOWTO: get data from MarkLogic and get it into the new audience db


0  NB: all of these steps should happen _outside_ of the Vagrant VM and you should
   use the ge-govexec project's virtualenv.

1  This process assumes that your target Postgres db has all the necessary tables and
   that those tables are empty.

2  To get user data from MarkLogic, adjust the command in `run_mlcp.sh` as necessary
   and then run it (mlcp). This will export all MarkLogic user data and write that data
   to the filesystem as xml documents. Make sure that the output directory you specify
   does not already exist.

3  When the mlcp process is done, you can use `ingest.py` to start populating the target
   tables.

   * first adjust all relevant settings in the CONFIG dict at the top of `ingest.py`

   * then run `python ingest.py all`, which will create all
     lists/newsletters/products/users, etc.
